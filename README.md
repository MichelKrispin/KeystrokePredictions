# KeystrokePredictions
This is a student project. It is neither complete nor very stable.

## Overview
In one sentence this project can:
Read text input ('password') from different persons and then learns from that input to predict who typed this word based on the timing between each keystroke.

## How to run
First of all you will need some dependencies so create a venv. (All projects below are for unix systems)
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./Main.py
```
