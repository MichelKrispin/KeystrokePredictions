# KeystrokePredictions
Small project which tries to predict the user who typed in a specific word based on the time taken between the different keystrokes.

# How to run
First of all you will need some dependencies so create a venv. (All projects below are for unix systems)
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
